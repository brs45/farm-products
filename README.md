project:RuralConnect is a web-based platform designed to help rural communities easily find and access essential products such as groceries, medicines, farming supplies, and household goods. The platform bridges the gap between suppliers and rural residents by providing a simple, user-friendly interface where users can view available services, browse products, and get detailed information about whatâ€™s accessible in their region.

The system is built as a full-stack application:

Backend: Handles product and service data storage, API endpoints, and user requests using Node.js + Express with a database (MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL).

Frontend: Displays the homepage, services list, and available products in an attractive and responsive layout.
